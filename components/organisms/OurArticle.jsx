              STONE MOUNTAINâ€“Bringing faith into the world of the special needs
              disabilities community, Nicholas Ihenacho is a founder of Rosary
              Makers of America that offers a special focus on art, prayer and

              From working with his son, Ikenna, who has Down syndrome, Ihenacho
              formed this nonprofit for others to express themselves by creating
              prayer beads. With the diverse range of guests and their families,
              the organization hopes to share their handiwork with area parishes
              and believers.
