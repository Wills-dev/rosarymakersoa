            The birth of our most beloved son Ikenna Michael Ihenacho was our
            inspiration for the founding of Rosary Makers of America. It was
            1996 and I was a pursuing my subspecialty training in nephrology
            (the study and treatment of kidney diseases) in the beautiful and
            picturesque town of Albuquerque New Mexico and my wife was working
            as a staff pharmacist in a local mail order pharmacy when our fifth
            child, Ikenna was conceived. It was our fourth and last pregnancy.
            At the third, we were blessed with a pair of twins. His four
            siblings were healthy and their pregnancies were uneventful and
            routine

        <SectionSubTitle text="A Routine Prenatal Visit and An Unexpected Intrauterine Diagnosis:" />
        <SectionParagraph className="">
          My wife had gone for one of her routine prenatal visits with her
          obstetrician and I had gone off to my job as a subspecialist doctor in
          training. On this visit she was to undergo a rather routine test,
          called amniocentesis (taking a sample of the baby fluid or amniotic
          fluid) to check in the laboratory on the health of the baby in the
          womb. Having had three previous pregnancies with four to kids to show
          for them, we were not in any way concerned about the test or its
          outcome until the obstetrician came back to pronounce or announce the
          result of the test. “Ma’am”, he began rather tentatively, “this looks
          like trisomy 23 (a medical jargon for Down’s syndrome) but just to be
          100% certain, we would send it out for a confirmatory test. Should the
          confirmatory test result come back positive, would you want to
          terminate the pregnancy”? He inquired. To this question my wife calmly
          and definitively told him, No. She further clarified to her
          obstetrician that pregnancy termination was simply not an option.
        </SectionParagraph>
        <SectionParagraph className="">
          Our after-dinner conversations that night was very somber and
          sobering, as my wife recounted to me how her day had gone and all that
          transpired at the obstetrician’s office. I commended her for her
          response and told her that I loved more than ever and that her
          response, that pregnancy termination was out of the question, was my
          response too. So, we waited for the confirmatory test report and we
          prayed and prayed but the confirmatory test report came back
          confirming the preliminary report as positive. For the remaining
          period of the pregnancy we continued to pray for an intrauterine
          healing or miracle for our son.

        <SectionParagraph className="">
          On February 12, 1997, our beautiful son Ikenna Micheal Ihenacho was
          born and I shade tears of joy when I heard his loud cry and held him
          close to my heart in the delivery room. My wife and I were full of joy
          and gratitude to God for his precious life and we wondered how his
          life would evolve. Trusting in our most holy, all loving, all knowing
          and all-powerful Father in Heaven, we return to life as usual and back
          to the “playground”, if you will, like little kids, handing over to
          the Father all that troubled us.

        <SectionParagraph className="">
          When our son Ikenna was barely one year old he underwent and
          open-heart surgery to correct some heart condition that was common in
          children with Down’s syndrome. The surgery went very well. The whole
          family, siblings, parents and grandparents had accompanied him to this
          surgery. I still remember this trip to the tertiary hospital where the
          surgery was performed as if it was yesterday. Following the surgery,
          he had remained in very good health and his life along with his older
          siblings had settled into the daily routines of school, church, music
          lessons, sports and other extracurricular events and activities.

        <SectionSubTitle text="What would the child do when he grows up?" />
        <SectionParagraph className="">
          Like all parents we wondered what Ikenna would do when he grows up. It
          was about his ten birthday that we began to ponder what he would do
          when he grows up. We were active in our Corpus Christi Catholic Church
          rosary apostolate, and we did meet to pray the rosary after the
          weekday Masses and before the 8 o’clock Sunday Masses. We published a
          leaflet to teach people how to pray the rosary and started a small
          group to learn the art of rosary making. This rosary making group met
          once a week and my wife and I went once a week with our son Ikenna to
          learn how to make rosary. Our rosary group did not last long as people
          moved on to other things and we took our newly acquired rosary making
          skills home with us and continued to make rosaries at home with
          Ikenna.
        </SectionParagraph>
        <SectionParagraph>
          Making rosaries was great fun and we all enjoyed the art. Our son
          Ikenna would work patiently and diligently at stringing the rosary
          beads and would beam with great joy and pride each time he completes a
          new rosary. Thus, the Rosary Makers of America, Inc. a center of
          rosary making excellence, was born to serve all special need young
          adults (ie young adults with developmental disability).
