                  Rosary Makers of America is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization
                  founded in the United States of America. More than thirty-five
                  percent of our healthy special needs people who graduate out
                  of the special need High school education in America spend
                  much time at home unemployed and unengaged. They are not in
                  college or university, not in vocational training and have no
                  job or employment. These dire statistics may be the same or
                  worse in various parts of the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is this stark and sad reality that is the motive force or
                  impetus for the founding of Rosary Makers of America, Inc.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The purpose and goal of Rosary Makers of America is to make or
                  craft the catholic rosaries ( a special string of prayer beads
                  for catholic Christians ) of the highest quality and in so
                  doing be men and women of prayer. Prayer, which is the
                  singular sustaining force of our human existence without which
                  humanity and human existence would have been reduced to dust
                  and ashes.

                At the beginning, our story was not added to the website because
                the founder did not want to make the organization and its story
                about himself and his family but rather about the bigger story
                that Rosary Makers of America stand for which is to give our
                special needs young adult a special place and a center of
                excellence where they can come to be gainfully employed and
                engaged in the art of making beautiful rosaries and in so doing
                enjoy the pride, the joy and the dignity of honest human labor.

              <p>
                When I insisted and reassured him that the story behind the
                formation of our organization, Rosary Makers of America, would
                not be a distraction, but an asset and that people truly wanted
                to know how Rosary Makers of America came to be, he penned down
                the story that would unfold hereunder which I have captioned
                “The Story behind Our Story”.

              <h6 className="text-bold">The Inspiration:</h6>
              <p>
                The birth of our most beloved son Ikenna Michael Ihenacho was
                our inspiration for the founding of Rosary Makers of America. It
                was 1996 and I was a pursuing my subspecialty training in
                nephrology (the study and treatment of kidney diseases) in the
                beautiful and picturesque town of Albuquerque New Mexico and my
                wife was working as a staff pharmacist in a local mail order
                pharmacy when our fifth child, Ikenna was conceived. It was our
                fourth and last pregnancy. At the third, we were blessed with a
                pair of twins. His four siblings were healthy and their
                pregnancies were uneventful and routine.
              </p>
              <h6 className="text-bold">
                A Routine Prenatal Visit and An Unexpected Intrauterine
                Diagnosis:
              </h6>
              <p>
                My wife had gone for one of her routine prenatal visits with her
                obstetrician and I had gone off to my job as a subspecialist
                doctor in training. On this visit she was to undergo a rather
                routine test, called amniocentesis (taking a sample of the baby
                fluid or amniotic fluid) to check in the laboratory on the
                health of the baby in the womb. Having had three previous
                pregnancies with four to kids to show for them, we were not in
                any way concerned about the test or its outcome until the
                obstetrician came back to pronounce or announce the result of
                the test. “Ma’am”, he began rather tentatively, “this looks like
                trisomy 23 (a medical jargon for Down’s syndrome) but just to be
                100% certain, we would send it out for a confirmatory test.
                Should the confirmatory test result come back positive, would
                you want to terminate the pregnancy”? He inquired. To this
                question my wife calmly and definitively told him, No. She
                further clarified to her obstetrician that pregnancy termination
                was simply not an option.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our after-dinner conversations that night was very somber and
                sobering, as my wife recounted to me how her day had gone and
                all that transpired at the obstetrician’s office. I commended
                her for her response and told her that I loved more than ever
                and that her response, that pregnancy termination was out of the
                question, was my response too. So, we waited for the
                confirmatory test report and we prayed and prayed but the
                confirmatory test report came back confirming the preliminary
                report as positive. For the remaining period of the pregnancy we
                continued to pray for an intrauterine healing or miracle for our
                son.

                A Valentine Baby, February 12, 1997:
              </h6>
              <p>
                On February 12, 1997, our beautiful son Ikenna Micheal Ihenacho
                was born and I shade tears of joy when I heard his loud cry and
                held him close to my heart in the delivery room. My wife and I
                were full of joy and gratitude to God for his precious life and
                we wondered how his life would evolve. Trusting in our most
                holy, all loving, all knowing and all-powerful Father in Heaven,
                we return to life as usual and back to the “playground”, if you
                will, like little kids, handing over to the Father all that
                troubled us.
              </p>
              <h6 className="text-bold">The brave infant:</h6>
              <p>
                When our son Ikenna was barely one year old he underwent and
                open-heart surgery to correct some heart condition that was
                common in children with Down’s syndrome. The surgery went very
                well. The whole family, siblings, parents and grandparents had
                accompanied him to this surgery. I still remember this trip to
                the tertiary hospital where the surgery was performed as if it
                was yesterday. Following the surgery, he had remained in very
                good health and his life along with his older siblings had
                settled into the daily routines of school, church, music
                lessons, sports and other extracurricular events and activities.
              </p>
              <p>
                What would the child do when he grows up? <br /> Like all
                parents we wondered what Ikenna would do when he grows up. It
                was about his ten birthday that we began to ponder what he would
                do when he grows up. We were active in our Corpus Christi
                Catholic Church rosary apostolate, and we did meet to pray the
                rosary after the weekday Masses and before the 8 o’clock Sunday
                Masses. We published a leaflet to teach people how to pray the
                rosary and started a small group to learn the art of rosary
                making. This rosary making group met once a week and my wife and
                I went once a week with our son Ikenna to learn how to make
                rosary. Our rosary group did not last long as people moved on to
                other things and we took our newly acquired rosary making skills
                home with us and continued to make rosaries at home with Ikenna.
              </p>
              <p>
                Making rosaries was great fun and we all enjoyed the art. Our
                son Ikenna would work patiently and diligently at stringing the
                rosary beads and would beam with great joy and pride each time
                he completes a new rosary. Thus, the Rosary Makers of America,
                Inc. a center of rosary making excellence, was born to serve all
                special need young adults (ie young adults with developmental
                disability).

                  <p>
                    At twenty-one he graduated out of a two-year post-secondary
                    school program in our county called Strive and could not
                    proceed any further. Ikenna has grown into a strong,
                    healthy, well-adjusted, kind, gentle and loving young man.
                    He is most beloved by his friends and family. He is a source
                    of great joy to me and my wife. His older siblings love him
                    greatly and are very protective of him. Since he has been
                    making rosary with us in the quiet of our home since he was
                    ten years old, we reasoned this could be his “day job” and
                    would like his peers to join. Hence the Rosary Makers of
                    America, Inc
